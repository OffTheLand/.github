## OffTheLand – a free, peer-to-peer “Google Maps for Food”
OffTheLand is a zero-fee, community-powered marketplace layer that plots real-world food and craft “micro-nodes” — backyards, homesteads, urban farms, workshops — onto an interactive map.
Every member has their own digital farmstand: a pin on the map showcasing what they grow, raise, or make, plus the story behind it. Buyers, barters, and sharers can explore their neighborhood, connect directly, and keep money (or produce) circulating locally.

**Why it matters**
Global supply chains hide how food is produced; OffTheLand surfaces the full how-it-was-grown or crafted story right next to every listing.

Small producers deserve a cost-free way to reach nearby eaters without market stall fees or platform commissions.

Communities are stronger when neighbors trade face-to-face and know the people behind their food.

**How it works** 

1. Drop a pin: Create an account, mark your location (approximate is fine), and open your digital farmstand.
2. List your goods: Snap photos, add a short note on your growing or making practices, and set whether you’re selling, bartering, or giving away.
3. Browse the map: Search by distance, product type, or production method to find what’s fresh around the corner.
4. Message & meet: Chat through the platform to arrange pickup or swap, then meet your neighbor and make the exchange.
5. Build trust: Leave a quick rating and keep the local loop turning with season-by-season updates.
